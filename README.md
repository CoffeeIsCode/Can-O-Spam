# Can-O-Spam
### Slogan: "Friend or Foe, they wont need an inbox no more." 
### Can-O-Spam works by signing the email address up for a long line of newsletters and other promotional junk. We also plan to send emails from systems that don't believe in an opt-out option and even if they do there are going to be reciepients for some pretty interesting emails as a resualt.
## Easy to use systems for filling someones email address. Becomes more aggressive and malicious overtime. 
## The current system has obtained 0 email addressess and has signed them up for 0 monthly newsletters.
Note: This system doesn't send any newsletters, but manipulates websites that offer such services.
