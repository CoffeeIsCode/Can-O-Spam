# Can-O-Spam

## Slogan: "Friend or Foe, they wont need an inbox no more." 

## Welcome to the Can-O-Spam README File

## How It Works
Can-O-Spam works by signing email address up for a long line of newsletters and other promotional junk, that in small doses is probably very useful information, but this isn't that. 
1. The victims account is submitted to the Can-O-Spam network by an annomous user where no other session information is stored. 
2. Our server then builds a queue of random newsletters to signed up to.
3. Email is signed up to more and more newsletters on a daily basis to avoid suspicion. 

Basic System Features
- The system will only take one email submission, but will make note if the email is entered multiple times. 
- As new newsletters are added to the website updates are made to queue.

We also plan to send emails from systems that don't believe in an opt-out option and even if they do there are going to be reciepients for some pretty interesting emails as a resualt.

## Easy to use systems for filling someones email address. Becomes more aggressive and malicious overtime. 
## The current system has obtained 0 email addressess and has signed them up for 0 monthly newsletters.
Note: This system doesn't send any newsletters, but manipulates websites that offer such services.
